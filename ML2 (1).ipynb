    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations that do not generalize to new data, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns of the data, resulting in low accuracy on both training and test sets. Overfitting can be mitigated by using more data, cross-validation, reducing model complexity, and applying regularization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "To reduce overfitting, techniques include increasing training data size, using simpler models, cross-validation to tune hyperparameters, and applying regularization (e.g., L1/L2 regularization, dropout). Ensuring balanced datasets and feature selection can also help improve model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Explain underfitting. List scenarios where underfitting can occur in ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns of the data, resulting in low accuracy on both training and test sets. It can happen with insufficient data, overly simple models, or inadequate feature selection. Examples include linear models for complex nonlinear relationships or using too few features for prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and how do they affect model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the delicate balance between a model's ability to capture underlying patterns (bias) and its sensitivity to noise in the training data (variance). High bias models are overly simplistic and may underfit, while high variance models capture noise and may overfit. Balancing bias and variance optimizes model performance, influencing decisions on model complexity, dataset size, and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Discuss some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models. How can you determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Common methods for detecting overfitting include cross-validation, learning curves, and validation set performance comparison. For underfitting, indicators include high training and validation error convergence. These methods help in assessing model performance across different datasets and guiding adjustments in model complexity and training strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Compare and contrast bias and variance in machine learning. What are some examples of high bias and high variance models, and how do they differ in terms of their performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Bias measures how well a model approximates the true underlying relationship. High bias models (underfitting) fail to capture complex patterns (e.g., linear regression for nonlinear data). Variance indicates sensitivity to fluctuations in training data, leading to overfitting with high variance models (e.g., complex neural networks with insufficient training data). Balancing bias and variance ensures optimal model performance, with bias-variance analysis guiding model selection and tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? Describe some common regularization techniques and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Regularization in ML prevents overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function, penalizing complex models to favor simpler ones. Common techniques include L1 (Lasso) regularization, which adds the absolute values of coefficients as penalties, and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which adds squared values of coefficients as penalties. Dropout regularization randomly drops neurons during training to prevent reliance on specific neurons. These techniques constrain model complexity, improving generalization to unseen data and mitigating overfitting tendencies."
